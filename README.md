# XSS Test Project

## Introduction

This project is intended to show and test various XSS Payloads.

### Target Audiences

#### Persuasion 

Often it is difficult to show what can be done with an XSS finding. For example if a pentester wants to persuade a customer of a finding.

This project can be used to persuade people more easily how dangerous a single XSS finding can be.

#### Reconstruction

You can use this project to setup rapidly a possible attack and see if it works and how it works.

#### Education

The project can be used to educate, for example new pentester or people interested in security, about XSS.
